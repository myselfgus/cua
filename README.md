# Client Project Starter

Choose one technology stack to scaffold (nothing has been generated yet):

| Option | Stack | Directory | Description |
| ------ | ----- | --------- | ----------- |
| 1 | Node.js + TypeScript Express API | `api/` | REST API backend with Express + Zod validation |
| 2 | React + Vite Frontend | `web/` | SPA frontend using React + Vite + TypeScript |
| 3 | Python FastAPI Backend | `python-api/` | Async Python API with FastAPI + Pydantic |
| 4 | .NET 8 Web API | `dotnet-api/` | C# Web API project |

## How to Proceed

Reply with the number (1-4) or the stack name you want. I will scaffold only that choice.

## After Selection (Planned Steps)

1. Initialize the chosen stack in its folder.
2. Add baseline tooling (linting/formatting/test) appropriate to stack.
3. Provide run/build/debug commands (PowerShell friendly).
4. Add a VS Code task + launch config if useful.
5. Update this README with concrete instructions.

## Optional Enhancements (post-scaffold)

- Dockerfile / compose
- Pre-commit hooks
- CI workflow
- Basic health endpoint / sample component

Let me know your selection or any customizations (e.g., package manager, Python version, auth needs) before scaffolding.
